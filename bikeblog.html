            You'll hear me talking to myself in the video.  By the time I was recording this trail ride, I may have gone a while without hearing a voice.  It's gets quiet in the woods!

        <div class="story"><p>In Pocohontas State Park I was on the Lake View Trail when I flipped over a rock and landed on my back.  Luckily, my camelbak water bladder saved me from injury and didn't even puncture!
            <br>
            I walked away with no serious damage, but unfortunately no one was there to see the epic wipeout.  I remember saying outloud "Figures, no one is here to high-five." in the vacant woods.  My bike took it like a champ.
