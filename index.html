			<p>I was excited, so I kept visiting
				kayak retailers online and in stores.  In the next few months I bought	an 11ft recreational kayak from Dick's Sporting Goods.  Then I purchased a second one so I could have the option to bring a pal.

			<p>Here's a newer boat I've owned since 2009.  It's a world of difference from the boats I started in.  It's nice to have for larger distances and longer days on the water.

			I used it weekly while I was a college student.  I put some serious miles on the green one.</p>

			<p>[2011]I upgraded the fleet!I took a trip to Farmville, where I know of a popular <a href="https://www.paddleva.com/" title="paddleva.com">kayak retailer</a> and picked out a more advanced boat that is meant for long day trips. The Tsunami 140 is 14ft long, making it a more hydrodynamic design.  I had saved money for this exact boat.</p>
